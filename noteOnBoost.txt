Building GraphAligner is finicky, and it's essential that the program be able to
build in the same way on different systems so the archives are not corrupted.
Therefore, I have included copies of the required boost libraries here.
They are generated by sudo apt install libboost-dev

I pulled the includes from /usr/local/include/boost, and the libs from
/usr/local/lib/
